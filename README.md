# Tic-Tac-Toe with Swift

## :calling: About
Tic-tac-toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'O' or an 'X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares. In our application, the humain (us) plays against the computer. The game starts with the first human gesture. Then the computer plays its turn. Whoever manages to draw three symbols in a line or diagonally wins the game and the game ends there.
This application is made with the architecture pattern : MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
